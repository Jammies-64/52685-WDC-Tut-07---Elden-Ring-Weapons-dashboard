## Technologies Used
- Tableau - version 2022.2 


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Weapons selection that filters data through a general category
- Filtering through Individual weapons across the statistics avaiilable under 'Attack Power'
- Summary of Guarded Damage Negation statistics
- Tooltip and Image preview of weapons
- Weight and average median weight visualisation 


## Setup

*Note that the Tableau dashboard will appear in different proportions depending on whatver screen resolution/size you are opening it on. I developed my project with Tableau on a 4K display.

Depending on your PC specs, the dashboard will most likely run with different levels of lag. my PC runs with 16GB RAM and I would consider that a minimum requirement to run the dashboard smoothly.

Clicking the link below will take you to a sharepoint where you can download the work book. Alternatively the raw file is available for download in the repository above

In order to run the dashboard with images you will need to download each folder, found here and upload them into the 'Shapes' folder located within the 'My Tableau Repository'. These files can be located and accessed by going to:
1. File directory ->
2. Documents ->
3. My Tableau Repository ->
4. Shapes
