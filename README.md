## General Information
The aim of this project was to create a visual tool intended to be used for effecicient and effective data browsing and comparison. The idea of this artefact came about from the large scope and volume of weapons and their statistics available from Elden Ring and I undertook this project out of a combined interest in data visualisation as well as the game itself. I think that using data visualisation to make information more accessible and searchable is a powerful tool that could be used for many things outside of game data and statistics, thus I wanted to use game data as an example to illustrate the possibilities with interactive data visualisations.


## Technologies Used
- Tableau - version 2022.2


## Features
- Weapons selection that filters data through a general category
- Filtering through Individual weapons across the statistics avaiilable under 'Attack Power'
- Ability to filter weapons by 'Top N' ranking
- Summary of Guarded Damage Negation statistics
- Image and title preview of each weapon
- Tooltips showing relevent data for comparison
- Weight and average median weight visualisation 


## Setup and Launch
Clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wKyIdw35kYPaGeJ1E4tfaFV0zwSeHteg/view?usp=sharing) will take you to a sharepoint where you can download the Tableau workbook. Alternatively the raw file is available for download in the repository above.

In order to run the Tableau workbook correctly you will need to download the corresponding CSV file found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R3qGyfm1N1ggL-kLK6fFQsZHNmr8V6GU/view?usp=sharing). Upon opening up the workbook you may be prompted to mannually locate the file as the correct data source and connect it to tableau.

_*Note that the Tableau dashboard will appear in different proportions depending on whatver screen resolution/size you are opening it on. I developed my project with Tableau displayed on a 4K monitor_.

_Depending on your PC specs, the dashboard will most likely run with different levels of lag. My PC runs with 16GB RAM and I would consider that the minimum standard requirement to run the dashboard smoothly_.


## Usage
Using and naviagting this interative dashboard is relatively straightforward and simple. By Selected filters from the menu on the right hand side and further browsing general weapons categories through the task bar up top.


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_
