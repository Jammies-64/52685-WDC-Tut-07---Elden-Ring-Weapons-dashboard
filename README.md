## General Information
The aim of this project was to create a visual tool intended to be used for efficiently and effetively parsing through data. The idea of this artefact came about from the large scope and volume of weapons and their statistics available from Elden Ring and I undertook this project out of a combined interest in data visualisation and the game itself. I think that using data visualisation to mkae information more accessible and searchable is a powerful tool that could be used for many things outside of game data and statistics.


## Technologies Used
- Tableau - version 2022.2


## Data Sources


## Features
- Weapons selection that filters data through a general category
- Filtering through Individual weapons across the statistics avaiilable under 'Attack Power'
- Summary of Guarded Damage Negation statistics
- Tooltip and Image preview of weapons
- Weight and average median weight visualisation 


## Setup and Launch
Clicking [here] will take you to a sharepoint where you can download the work book. Alternatively the raw file is available for download in the repository above.

In order to run the dashboard with all assets (images) you will need to download each folder, found [here] and upload them into the 'Shapes' folder located within the 'My Tableau Repository'. These files can be located and accessed by going to your PC's:
1. File directory ->
2. Documents ->
3. My Tableau Repository ->
4. Shapes 

_Note that the Tableau dashboard will appear in different proportions depending on whatver screen resolution/size you are opening it on. I developed my project with Tableau on a 4K display_.

_Depending on your PC specs, the dashboard will most likely run with different levels of lag. My PC runs with 16GB RAM and I would consider that the minimum standard requirement to run the dashboard smoothly_.


## Usage
Using and naviagting this interative dashboard is relatively straightforward and simple. By Selected filters from the menu on the right hand side and further browsing general weapons categories through the task bar up top,
